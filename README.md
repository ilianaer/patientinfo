# Patient Info

This is a repository for the Patient Info project for [the Upskilling Labs'](https://theupskillinglabs.org/) 2026 AI and Health Systems cycle. The AI & Health Systems cohort will focus on leveraging AI to identify and develop solutions addressing some of the most pressing challenges in the healthcare system. 

# Problem Statement
**The Challenge:** The "Patient-as-Data-Courier" Burden

The current healthcare landscape is defined by fragmented data silos that fail to communicate, forcing patients to act as the primary manual link between disparate providers. This reliance on patient-led data transmission creates a "Information Gap" characterized by:

- *Systemic Inefficiency:* Patients are burdened with repetitive data entry and manual history reporting at every point of care.

- *Clinical Risk:* Hand-carried or transcribed data is prone to errors, omissions, and delays, which can be catastrophic during time-critical medical events.

- *Lack of Agency:* While patients are the subjects of the data, they lack a centralized, sovereign way to manage and deploy it.

**The Opportunity:** By shifting the focus from "breaking down silos" (which has historically failed due to technical and competitive barriers) to a patient-centric data model, we can ensure that accurate, real-time health information follows the individual, rather than being trapped within the institution.

# About The Upskilling Labs 
The Upskilling Labs seeks to equip everyday Americans with new skills, bolstered confidence, and stronger networks through hands-on learning, peer-driven community, and local expert networks.

During a build cycle, participants form self-directed teams (pods) to: 
- *Identify* a problem statement
- *Research* the problem space and formulate a solution hypothesis
- *Validate* their solution hypothesis by conducting UX research 
- *Build* and present their solutions
